# PHP MailChimp v3 API client

API Client for MailChimp v3 with a complete model

Uses [MailChimp API v3](http://developer.MailChimp.com/documentation/MailChimp/reference/overview/).

## Development Status

This project is still in Alpha stage. Expect many changes to pretty much everything.

The API methods implemented today are just the ones that we needed at the moment, and much more is needed to complete the client.

### JSON Schema

MailChimp uses JSON Schema to define their API. Example can be viewed here: http://us1.API.MailChimp.com/schema/3.0/Definitions/Campaigns/POST.json

To conform with the JSON Schema we use a tool to build our model based on the schema files. We could not find any good PHP code generators for that so we built our own. Link coming soon. 

Example generation:
```bash
php ../json-schema-php-generator/bin/run.php generate \\
  --phpcs .php_cs.dist \\
  --extends 'Stefna\MailChimp\Other\AbstractData' \\
  --namespace 'Stefna\MailChimp\Model\CampaignPatch' \\
  --appendNamespace \\
  -vv \\
  http://us1.api.MailChimp.com/schema/3.0/Definitions/Campaigns/PATCH.json \\
   src/Model/Campaign/
```

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5 with cURL extension
* Guzzle or any other "php-http/client-implementation

## Basic usage

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
$client = new \Stefna\MailChimp\Client($httpClient, $apiKey);
$allMembers = $client->lists()->members($listId)->all();
$email = $allMembers[0]->emailAddress;
```
